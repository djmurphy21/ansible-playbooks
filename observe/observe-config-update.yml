# Synopsis
# This playbook manages the observe-agent service on all target hosts by stopping the service, updating configuration files, restarting the service, and validating its status.

# Description
# The playbook performs the following tasks:
# 1. Stops the observe-agent service to safely apply configuration changes.
# 2. Copies the custom otel-collector configuration file to the specified directory on the target host.
# 3. Copies the custom logs configuration file to the specified directory on the target host.
# 4. Restarts the observe-agent service to apply the new configurations.
# 5. Ensures the observe-agent service is running and enabled to start at boot.

# Notes
# - Verify that configuration file paths are correct and accessible.
# - Ensure the observe-agent service is installed and configured correctly on all target hosts.
# - Adjust file permissions and ownership as needed to match your environment.

# Example
# To run this playbook, execute:
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> <playbook.yml> --limit <hostname_or_group>
#
# Replace `<inventory_file>` with the path to your inventory file and `<playbook.yml>` with the name of this playbook.
